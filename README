2. BSP Kernel and Distros
=========================

The following table summarizes the valid Wind River Linux distros for this BSP.
'Y' in each content cell stands for supported; 'N' stands for not supported:

  +--------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
  | valid/distro |   wrlinux   | wrlinux-cgl | wrlinux-ovp |
  +--------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
  |    valid     |      Y      |      N      |      N      |
  +--------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+

For the supported kernel type for this BSP, please check the TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES
by running 'bitbake -e virtual/kernel | grep "^TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES="'.

Note: The preempt-rt ktype is available for this BSP/Machine at this time.


3. Board Specific Patches
=========================

To get a list of patches applied to the kernel specific to this BSP along with
patch descriptions use git-whatchanged on the default kernel. For example:

	%> cd tmp-glibc/work-shared/<bsp_name>/kernel-source
	%> git whatchanged <kernel_version>/standard/base..<kernel_version>/standard/<bsp_name>


4. Boot Instructions
====================

The typical u-boot settings apply to these boards. You will need to use
setenv, printenv and saveenv, to configure, display and store respectively
your network configuration details and kernel command line. In order to
TFTP a kernel, you need at a minimum to set the following:

	- ipaddr
	- gatewayip
	- netmask
	- serverip
	- loadaddr
	- dtbfile
	- dtbaddr
	- ethaddr
	- eth1addr

Your board may ship with the values for the MAC address of
the Ethernet interfaces set to the defaults compiled into the
u-boot image.  You should set the ethaddr, eth1addr and so on
as per the manufacturer assigned values, usually indicated with
a sticker on the board.

Target specifics are usually set in the "bootargs" variable, and the
kernel image is set in the "bootfile" variable. Don't forget that if you
want these values to be available after a power cycle you will need to run
the saveenv command.

Typically convenience macros exist that will create a complete bootargs
command line for the kernel based on variables that contain individual
settings.  Since these macros exist as env variables themselves, they
may or may not be present depending on who installed and configured
u-boot for the board.

The console device for the board is ttyLF0 at 115200 baud. For the DTB
address, 0x8FE00000  was used with success by Wind River. The load address
must be high enough to not interfere with kernel decompression. A value
of 0x8A080000 was used with success for all kernels tested by Wind River.

4.1 NFS Root File System
------------------------

Example settings for the monitor (u-boot) are shown below:

nfsboot=setenv bootargs root=/dev/nfs rw nfsroot=$serverip:$rootpath \
ip=$ipaddr:$serverip:$gatewayip:$netmask:$hostname:$netdev:off \
console=$consoledev,$baudrate $othbootargs;tftp $loadaddr $bootfile; \
tftp $fdtaddr $fdtfile;booti $loadaddr - $fdtaddr
ethaddr=00:04:9F:02:00:FD
eth1addr=00:04:9F:02:01:FD
eth2addr=00:04:9F:02:02:FD
loadaddr=0x8EE00000
fdtaddr=0x80000000
gatewayip=192.168.1.1
netmask=255.255.255.0
ipaddr=192.168.1.100
serverip=192.168.1.2
netdev=eth0
bootfile=Image
fdtfile=s32g399a-cvc-fl.dtb
rootpath=/tftpboot/rootfs
consoledev=ttyLF0
baudrate=115200

5. Creating Partitioned Images(WIC)
===================================

User can use the OpenEmbedded Image Creator, wic, to create the properly
partitioned image on a SD card. The wic command
generates partitioned images from existing OpenEmbedded build artifacts.
User can refer to the below URL to get more WIC details:

https://docs.yoctoproject.org/singleindex.html#creating-partitioned-images-using-wic

This BSP supports disk images for SD card.
After build the project, user will get a WIC image under the directory
tmp-glibc/deploy/images/aptiv-cvc-fl/ ,such as:

tmp-glibc/deploy/images/aptiv-cvc-fl/wrlinux-image-<rootfs_type>-aptiv-cvc-fl.wic

Then user can write the output image to a SD card:

5.1 Burn images to SD card
--------------------------

To burn WIC image to SD card, user only need to execute the below command:

# dd if=wrlinux-image-std-aptiv-cvc-fl.wic of=/dev/your_sd_dev

5.2 Set uboot env
-----------------

Board can boot automatically by set the below uboot environment variables:

=> setenv bootfile Image; setenv fdtfile s32g399a-cvc-fl.dtb; setenv loadaddr 0x8EE00000; setenv fdtaddr 0x80000000;

=> setenv bootargs console=ttyLF0,115200n8 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw

=> setenv bootcmd 'fatload mmc 0:1 $loadaddr $bootfile; fatload mmc 0:1 $fdtaddr $fdtfile; booti $loadaddr - $fdtaddr'

=> saveenv; run bootcmd;

6. Features
===========

6.1 FLEXCAN
-----------

Detail verification commands as below:

	# ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 800000 dbitrate 8000000 fd on
	# ip link set can1 up type can bitrate 800000 dbitrate 8000000 fd on
	# candump can0 &
	# cansend can1 5A1#11.22.33.44.55.66.77.88
	# ip -d -s link show can0
	# ip -d -s link show can1

If can0 dumps data from can1, FLEXCAN feature works fine.

6.2 ATF
-------

The ARM Trusted Firmware (ATF, or TF-A) is a software component of
the linux BSP with a double role as a bootloader and Secure Monitor.
As a bootloader, it runs before U-Boot on the A53 boot core and takes
over some of the core and SoC initializations such as clocks or MC_ME
partitions (mostly for those peripherals and subsystems that the ATF
needs). As a Secure Monitor, the TF-A provides power management services
to other software components, via a standard API/ABI called PSCI. For
details of ATF, please refer to the sections

	"11 ARM Trusted Firmware"
and
	"22 Power Management"

in "S32G2_Linux_BSP35.0_User_Manual.pdf".

NOTICE:
    For hardware reasons, the power management features are not supported for
	Aptiv CVC boards (Both Sousa and FL).

6.2.1 CPU Hotplug verify steps
------------------------------

With ATF enabled, CPU Hotplug is supported, below is the steps
to verify this feature:

  1. check current online cpu numbers

	root@nxp-s32g:~#  nproc
	4

  2. offline cpu1

	root@nxp-s32g:~# echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
	NOTICE:  SIRQ78: set affinity failed(-22).
	process 201 (rngd) no longer affine to cpu1
	process 199 (rngd) no longer affine to cpu1
	CPU1: shutdown
	psci: CPU1 killed (polled 0 ms)
	root@nxp-s32g:~# nproc
	3

  3. online cpu1

	root@nxp-s32g:~# echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
	NOTICE:  S32G TF-A: s32g_pwr_domain_on: booting up core 1

	root@nxp-s32g:~# nproc
	4
	root@nxp-s32g:~#

6.3 Build ATF
---------------

By default, the atf image is compiled and installed. If you want atf to be manually
compiled separately, use the following command：

        # bitbake atf-s32g

6.4 Build U-Boot
----------------

By default, the u-boot image is compiled and installed. If you want u-boot to be manually
compiled separately, use the following command：

        # bitbake u-boot-s32

6.5 IPCF
--------

IPCF is short for "Inter-Platform Communication Framework" on NXP S32G
platform, it is designed to work on various hardware platforms and operating
systems. Prior to being used it needs to be integrated in the operating
systems running on each platform. For S32G, to use this feature, users need
to manually prepare application for M7 cores(refer to the following section
6.6.1 "IPCF application on M7 side"), and the A53 linux side components
have already integrated into wrlinux(please refer to the following section
6.6.2 "Enable IPCF feature in wrlinux").

6.5.1 IPCF application on M7 side
---------------------------------

Please note that, application on M7 side is not a pre-built binary file, it
should be built manually, as preparation, the following(all of them can be
found on Flexera) shoul be setup in the following order on user's local host
machine:

	1. S32 Design Studio 3.4
	2. S32 Design Studio 3.4 Development Packages for Offline Use,
	   Support for S32G Family
	3. Real Time Drivers (RTD) 4.4 version 3.0.0 D2112 (use file
	   with _updatesite.zip in the name and install through
	   Extensions and Updates in S32 Design Studio)
	4. IPCF version 4.5.0 D2201 (use file with _updatesite.zip in
	   the name and install through Extensions and Updates in
	   S32 Design Studio)

For detail informations about the above packages setup, installation and
build steps, please refer to the documents:

	"S32DS_Installation_Guide_3.4.0.pdf"
	"SW32_RTD_4.4_3.0.0_D2112_ReleaseNotes.pdf"
	"SW32G_IPCF_4.5.0_D2201_ReleaseNotes.pdf"

and etc., which can be found in related packages downloaded from flexra.

And if the IPCF application on M7 side build successfully following the
related documents, then users can find the binary file:

	"IPCF_Example_S32G399_M7_0.bin"

from S32DS IPCF example project.

6.5.2 Enable IPCF feature in wrlinux
------------------------------------

If users want to enable IPCF feature on A53 side linux system, please add
the following lines in the <project-build-dir>/conf/local.conf:

	IPCF_M7_APP_BIN_DIR = "/path/to/your-ipcf-m7-app/"
	IMAGE_INSTALL:append = ' ipc-shm'

then build the project as normal:

	bitbake wrlinux-image-std

the IPCF related drivers and M7 side app binaries IPCF_Example_S32G399_M7_0.bin
will be built into WIC image.

NOTICE:
    The M7 side binary default name is IPCF_Example_S32G399_M7_0.bin, and it's
defined by the variable IPCF_M7_APP_BIN_NAME or IPCF_M7_APP_BIN_NAME_S32G3
respectively, users can use different binary names by modifying these variables,
or set related variable(s) to empty if it is unneeded for users.

6.5.3 IPCF verify steps
-----------------------

If both the IPCF application on M7 side and IPCF related drivers in linux
are all build successfully, then users can follow the below steps to verify
this feature:

	1. dd WIC image(build following 6.6.2 section) into one SD-card

	2. using the SD-card to bootup the board

	3. stop in u-boot stage, and excute following commands

		a> disable Data Cache from uboot:
			=>dcache off
		b> zero-set SRAM shared memory used by both sample apps:
			=>mw.q 0x34000000 0x0 0x100000
		c> load IPCF binary in SRAM:
			=>fatload mmc 0:1 0x80000000 IPCF_Example_S32G399_M7_0.bin
		   then:
			=>cp.q 0x80000000 0x34300000 0x30000
			=>dcache on;
		d> start M7 core (the argument is the address of the Interrupt Vector):
			=>startm7 0x34401000;
		e> boot Linux:
			=>boot

	4. after linux system startup, enable ipcf driver support on linux

		modprobe ipc-shm-sample


	5. run ipcf test command

		echo 10 > /sys/kernel/ipc-shm-sample/ping

If all the above steps succeed, the result messages should be like:

	root@nxp-s32g:~# echo 10 > /sys/kernel/ipc-shm-sample/ping
	ipc-shm-sample: starting demo...
	ipc-shm-sample: ch 0 >> 20 bytes: SENDING MESSAGES: 10

6.6 Secure boot
---------------

About the detailed description, please refer to the README in layers/nxp-s32g/s32g-secure-boot.

6.6.1 Specific Boot Steps For Aptiv
-----------------------------------

Aptiv board has its own load address, so user should use below configuration name and load address
to replace the corresponding ones in section 3.4 of
layers/nxp-s32g/s32g-secure-boot/README

configuration Name: conf-freescale_s32g399a-cvc-fl.dtb
Load Address of fitImage: 0x8A080000

Detailed steps as below:
	# fatload mmc 0:1 0x8A080000 fitImage
	# run mmcargs
	# bootm 0x8A080000#conf-freescale_s32g399a-cvc-fl.dtb

6.7 PFE
-------

The NXP PFE (Packet Forwarding Engine) offloads the processing of Ethernet packets
from the host cores, yielding higher performance and lower power than pure software
processing can achieve.

PFE is a component of S32G399A SOC. It must be installed with the firmware to use.
PFE firmware is not shipped with SDK, customers have to contact NXP to get permission
and download the PFE firmware.

6.7.1 PFE firmware
------------------

PFE is a firmware-based module. Load the firmware before using PFE.
The firmwares name are "s32g_pfe_class.fw" and "s32g_pfe_util.fw" with
version 1.5.0, which have to be downloaded from NXP Software.

6.7.2 PFE Master
------------------

1. Add the "pfe" package to the system through including the
following line in your local.conf:

    # Set firmware dir
    PFE_LOCAL_FIRMWARE_DIR = "<The firmwares fully directory path, eg: lib/firmware/>"

    # Install pfe in rootfs
    IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " pfe"

    # Install pfe in initramfs, this is required when initramfs is used,
    # for example, when feature/ostree is enabled.
    PACKAGE_INSTALL:append = " pfe"

    The variable PFE_LOCAL_FIRMWARE_DIR indicates the location where can
    get the firmwares s32g_pfe_class.fw and s32g_pfe_util.fw.
    And after setting the above variables, the firmwares can be installed
    into WIC image's first boot partition automatically when build WIC image.

2. Built and install them:

	# bitbake wrlinux-image-<small/std>

3. Boot Sousa board and stop in U-Boot, make sure that the U-Boot environment
variable "fdt_file" is set to be "s32g399a-cvc-fl.dtb" in which the pfe0~2 is
in master mode, and make sure that pfeng_mode is enabled.

	U-Boot=>setenv fdt_file 's32g399a-cvc-fl.dtb'
	U-Boot=>setenv pfeng_mode 'enable,sgmii,sgmii,sgmii'

4. After entering WRLinux, the pfe0~2 interface can be seen:

6.7.3 PFE Slave
---------------

NOTE: The PFE slave mode is not verified at FL board.
